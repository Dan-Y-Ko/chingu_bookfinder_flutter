# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production

```

_\*Note: Only development mode has been worked on._

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

_\*Note: will update this with the proper commands._

Presentation Layer

- This layer is responsible for rendering the UI. Any user interaction that involves business logic is delegated to the application layer.

Application Layer

- This layer consists of the bloc and service.
- The bloc acts as the intermediary between the UI and the service. It is responsible for input/output of state only.
- The service is where the core business logic lives.

Data Layer

- This layer is where any external api or packages that needs to be used is configured.
- It is represented in the packages folder in this project to allow reusability across projects.
